# Engagement charter

The Engagement Charter is a concise, single-page document collaboratively created by the Thoughtworks team and the client sponsor to define the purpose and desired outcomes of an engagement. It is distinct from the formal Statement of Work (SOW), which typically focuses on outputs needed for procurement.
The charter serves as a unified, high-level elevator pitch that all stakeholders, including the Thoughtworks team (TW) and client stakeholders, can use to articulate the value and focus of the engagement.
This play is critical for shifting the focus from transactional outputs to strategic outcomes, and for ensuring alignment at the start of an engagement.
The charter aligns mindsets and helps mitigate the risk that significant organizational or business context changes have occurred between the SOW being signed and the TW team starting.

## Use this play to:

Focus on outcomes
Align mindsets
Address organisational change
Amplify success by clearly defining the intended outcomes and shared vision.

## Expert tip

The power of this 1-hour session comes from the core decision-makers. Insist on a small, focused group. Resist the urge to turn this into a large group meeting. A small group ensures genuine, high-speed alignment on outcomes; a large group often results in discussions focused on tactical outputs.
 
## Time required

1 hour

## Who participates

Engagement Lead, Client Sponsor (optionally 1 additional key stakeholder; TW Principal or BA)

## How often

At the start of each engagement

## Running the play

### Before the workshop

This 60-minute session aligns the client sponsor and engagement principal on purpose, scope, outcomes, and values. The result will be the raw material for a 1-page Engagement Charter.
1. Connect with the client sponsor
Connect with the client sponsor and share the purpose of the workshop and expected outcomes. Let them know the power of this 1-hour session comes from the core decision-makers Ask them to limit attendance to themselves and one other key stakeholder (maximum).
Emphasize the goal is alignment, not consensus. 

2. Pre-fill the charter
Add the organisation’s Purpose, Vision, and Goals (from public sources or client teams).
Draft a preliminary “Why Now” based on the SOW or prior discussions.
Avoid blank canvas syndrome. A starting point accelerates discussion.

3. Stakeholder priming
2–3 days prior to the workshop, ask each participant to briefly reflect on two questions: 
* Why is this work important right now?
* What is the single most successful outcome of this engagement?

This primes the stakeholders to think in terms of outcomes before they enter the room, maximizing the hour.

4. Align the TW team
If a second TWer is joining, ensure you are clear on your roles, e.g., silent note-taker, co-facilitators etc. 
Agree upfront on facilitation style:
Structured board session – participants contribute directly on a collaborative board.
Flowing discussion – facilitator leads the conversation, while a team member captures notes live (visible on screen if desired).
Align internally before the session on the chosen approach, the purpose, and the expected outputs (raw notes to enable the creation of a 1-page charter).
 
### Running the workshop (60 mins)

5. Opening and framing
[6 mins]
Start the workshop with short introductions (if needed). State the purpose: "We’re here to align on our shared purpose, scope, and values so the engagement starts with clarity and a shared mindset."
Keep agenda framing light. Either walk through the agenda briefly or simply highlight the high-level purpose of the session.
Confirm the pre-filled organisation’s vision, purpose, and goals, and explain why this matters: to ensure our work ties back to business priorities and delivers aligned value.

6. Context and urgency: the why
[8 mins]
Playback your understanding of why now.
Ask stakeholders to share in their own words:
Why is this the right time?
What business objective does this link to?
Who is the primary beneficiary or audience?
Capture key drivers: business context, urgency, triggers.

7. Understand the problem and audience
[5 mins]
Ask: What problem are we solving?
Clarify: Who is this for?
Capture customer/stakeholder lens.

8. Outcomes and success
[15 mins]
Ask: 
What does success look like? 
What does success not look like?
What will outcomes enable us to do?
At the end, what do we want to say about this engagement?
What’s our hypothesis of the value? (to business, stakeholders, customers)
How will we know if it delivered that value? (what might be early signals we can look for?)
When participants struggle to articulate success, they rarely struggle to define failure. Asking "What does success not look like?" is a powerful shortcut to defining boundaries and clarifying desired outcomes.
Tip: prioritize clarity over exhaustion. Once you capture the core input, move on immediately. Don't labor the point by asking every single question. The goal is alignment, not detailed interrogation.

9. Scope and boundaries
[5 mins]
Ask: 
What is in scope?
What is out of scope?
Capture inclusions, exclusions, and guardrails.
This could be systems, teams, or business units. Once again, starting with what is out of scope can be easier for client stakeholders to articulate. 
Also be sure to let them know scope can be updated later, we don’t need a definitive list at this moment in time. 

10. Risks and stakeholders
[8 mins]
Ask: 
Who can make or break this engagement, and why?
What do we want their narrative about this work to be?
What are the biggest risks to success?

11. Objectives and values
[8 mins]
Ask: 
What are our objectives for this engagement itself? What do we need to achieve during these weeks/months together?
What principles do we value in this partnership? (e.g., Transparency, Pragmatism, Timely Feedback).

12. Wrap up and next steps
[5 mins]
Summarize the key outcomes captured. Confirm the hypothesis of value. Agree that the raw notes will be synthesized into a 1-page draft Charter for final review and sign-off within 24 hours.
Give the client an opportunity to share anything that’s on their mind, or ask further questions. 

### After the workshop

Synthesize notes into the 1-page Engagement Charter.
Use the templates/samples (links have been provided at the bottom of this page) as a guide, but tailor for the client.
Remember: multiple questions may contribute to a single charter field. Asking from different angles helps uncover the real answers.
Using GenAI to synthesize outputs is recommended, however only use approved tools and protect client IP.

# Facilitation tips

Let conversation flow: capture insights where they fit best.
Keep the group small: builds trust and faster outcomes.
Always capture live on a shared board/document for transparency.
Keep time tight: move discussion along if stuck.
Playback what you’ve captured: “So, can we agree the problem is X?”
