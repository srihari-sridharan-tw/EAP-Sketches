What is Enterprise Architecture?



The term “Enterprise Architecture” means many different things to people. We’ll take one rather narrow definition for the purposes of this book because it is intended to help Thoughtworkers deliver a specific type of consulting engagement. 



For our purposes, Enterprise Architecture is the practice of aligning the people, processes and assets of technology to best deliver business outcomes. 



Sometimes it can be described simply as aligning technology strategy to business strategy. It is important to note Enterprise Architecture almost always requires alignment between business and technology strategies, or implementing technology to deliver business outcomes. As is implied by the name, it is partly about architecting the entire enterprise, and shouldn’t be solely concerned with technology decisions.  

In The Software Architect Elevator, Gregor Hohpe describes enterprise architecture as “the glue between business architecture and IT architecture” He breaks it down into the following 8 steps:

Understand the business strategy

Translate into an IT strategy

Create transparency

Define IT target picture

Define a roadmap

Harmonize and govern

Obtain feedback and refine

Coach and mentor

In this playbook we won’t cover any of the existing frameworks that have been codified over the years. Frameworks such as TOGAF and Zachman can be useful for remembering all the bits and pieces of Enterprise Architecture that must be defined and might be useful as an adjunct to the material covered here. But that’s not the main focus of our work in these consulting engagements.
