# Stakeholder impact mapping

Stakeholder Impact Mapping is a collaborative technique that links a business goal with the necessary stakeholder actions and behaviors. It aids strategy definition and alignment by clarifying stakeholder interests at various levels, making high-level strategies governable, measurable, and executable.
This method shifts focus from technology outputs to organizational outcomes, bridging strategy and delivery planning. It explicitly highlights dependencies and assumptions, particularly who needs to act differently to achieve the goal. The map is a shared artifact that clarifies causality: how outcomes depend on people, not projects.

## Use this play to:

Validate strategic alignment 
Proactively address stakeholder concerns and mitigate identified organizational risks.
Align the team and sponsor on the behavioral changes required for success, making hidden assumptions about stakeholder influence explicit.
Focus the program on outcomes over outputs, ensuring the work directly targets the human and organizational factors that drive impact.
Validate the assumptions from the Engagement Charter about who can enable or block progress.

## Expert tip

Use Stakeholder Impact Mapping early in an initiative to clarify how stakeholder behaviors drive outcomes, align teams, and expose hidden assumptions about influence and risk.

## Time required

60 - 90 minutes

## Who participates

Project team and project sponsor. If following on from Engagement Charter, keep the same participants. 

## How often

At the start of each engagement, ideally immediately following the Engagement Charter play.

## Running the play

### Before the workshop

1. Reaffirm the goal
The core goal (the "why") is taken directly from the Engagement Charter (or the SOW, if the Charter hasn't been written). This ensures the impact map is grounded in the strategic purpose of the engagement.
Prefill your impact mapping template with the goal.

### Running the workshop

2. Opening and framing
Start by sharing the purpose of the session: "To connect our core goal with the actions and behaviors of key stakeholders required to achieve it. In doing so, we’re shifting our focus from outputs to outcomes."
Review the goal you have prefilled and confirm it's the right focus for the discussion and covers the “why”.

3. Identify key actors (who)
Brainstorm key individuals or groups that can either help or hinder the goal.
Who are the stakeholders?
Who has the most influence on this program's success?
Who can block or present challenges?
Who is the primary beneficiary of the change?
Capture their current relationship to the goal (Supporter, Neutral, Skeptic). Place the high-leverage and high-risk actors on the map first.
Tip: You may only need to map the top 5-7 most critical actors to get 80% of the value. Prioritize quality over quantity.

4. Define desired impacts (what)
For each Actor, ask: “What would this actor need to do differently to help us achieve the goal?”
What are their current concerns or behaviors that could impact our progress?
What would need to happen for them to feel confident in the success of the program?
What change in behavior would signal progress?
Use verb-based phrasing (e.g., start using, reduce escalations, increase collaboration).
This creates an outcome-first mindset.
The Impact column links the Actor to the Goal. This step is the heart of the play.

5. Identify enabling work (how)
Brainstorm what deliverables, capabilities, or initiatives could enable those behavioral changes.
These are not project plans, think levers or supports (e.g., new dashboard, training program, policy change).
Ask: What do we need to deliver to help the actor achieve the desired Impact?
This step directly converts a required behavior (impact) into a concrete piece of work (deliverable).

6. Review assumptions and risks
Discuss where assumptions exist about stakeholder willingness, capacity, or influence.
Ask: What could prevent this stakeholder from changing behavior?
Capture these as risks or dependencies.

7. Summarize insights and close
Wrap up the session by highlighting:
Critical stakeholders and behaviors that matter most
Assumptions or risks to address early
Implications for scope change, or project planning
Confirm the project sponsor agrees the deliverables are the right things to build because they directly lead to the required impacts and thus the ultimate goal.

### After the workshop

8. Socialize and validate
Share the completed map with the broader project team if they weren’t in the room for the activity. 
Use it as a constant artifact to prioritize features. 
Ask: If a feature doesn't drive a desired Impact, why are we building it?

9. Manage risks
The actors who have a significant negative impact but have limited deliverables mapped against them are your program's biggest organizational risk. Make sure these are flagged and you keep your eye on them. Be proactive in engaging them and keeping them informed. 

10. Roadmap input
Use the deliverables as the initial, outcome-driven items for the program's backlog or roadmap.

## Outputs

* A visual map linking goal → actors → impact → deliverables.
* A prioritized list of critical behaviors and related risks.
* Clear alignment on what success looks like in human terms.

## Facilitator tips

* Encourage teams to work top-down (goal → actors → impacts → deliverables) first, then bottom-up to check if the enablers truly drive the behaviors identified.
* Keep the conversation at the behavioral level, not system features.
* Push for specificity: “Who exactly needs to do what differently?”
* Revisit the map throughout the program to test if the desired impacts are being realized.
