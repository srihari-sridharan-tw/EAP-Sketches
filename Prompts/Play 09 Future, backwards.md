Play #9

# Future, backwards

As a group, create a shared understanding of the current architectural state and what events in the past led to this. Examine how the organization might navigate towards a more desired state and away from an undesired one.
Future, Backwards will be a step towards defining a technical vision. It’s important to create a shared understanding of where the organization is at, and how it came to be. You will likely find, depending on tenure, the picture will look different for each person in the group. There is no right or wrong answer, record all perspectives as you go. 

## Use this play to:

Embed lessons from the organization’s past in decision making
Aid in conflict resolution between different groups with opposing views
Create a shared view of a complex problem
Give leaders an overview of the hopes and fears of their organization 
Help leaders understand which entrained patterns of past perception are influencing the organization’s future

## Expert tip

This is a great activity to start forming the technical vision and desired to-be state.

## Time required

2 hours

## Who participates

Architects

## How often

Once-off

## Fundamentals

The diagram below describes the 7 states that make up the activity. The picture shows the shape of the diagram and where the hexies from each state should be placed as you work through the activity. 

## Turning Points Diagram

  Top Row (Key Concepts)

  - Turning points backwards from heaven (Pink hexagon)
  - Turning points on hell or heaven pathway (Purple hexagon)
  - Heaven (Green hexagon)

  Central Pathway

  The diagram shows a hexagonal pathway visualization with colored hexagons representing different trajectory paths:
  - Pink hexagons - Path backward from heaven
  - Green hexagons - Path toward heaven
  - Purple hexagons - Critical decision points between heaven and hell pathways
  - Teal hexagons - Path backward from current state
  - Dark blue/black hexagons - Path backward from hell
  - Orange hexagons - Path toward hell
  - Gray hexagons - Current state

  Bottom Row (Key States)

  - Turning points backwards from Current State (Teal hexagon)
  - Turning points backwards from hell (Dark blue hexagon)
  - Hell (Orange hexagon)
  - Current State (Gray hexagon)

  Connections

  - Dashed lines connect the top concepts to their respective pathways in the central hexagonal grid
  - Solid lines connect the bottom states to their corresponding pathways
  - The central grid shows the interconnected nature of different paths and decision points between current state, heaven, and hell

## Running the play

1. Overview of future, backwards
Provide an overview by letting participants know the activity allows us to take a complex problem and understand the many factors around it and to construct a vision of the system - it will help us to create a shared view of a complex problem. Let people know we will be working through (significant) ambiguity; the process requires you to go through a series of steps without knowing the outcome until the process is finished.

2. Set the scene
Run through how we’ll work (groups, tooling, safe space). Run a short warm-up activity so people feel comfortable.

3. Current state
Ask the group to spend ~5 mins writing down as many points as they can to describe the current state (1 per hexie). For remote sessions, as the facilitator, be the scribe too to allow participants to maintain a conversation and stay on the same page.   
If you’re running the activity with multiple groups, it would be best to have a facilitator within each group. 

4. Turning points backwards from current state
What is the most significant event in the immediate past which shaped/caused the current state? Ask the group to identify the turning points (key events) back from the current state. Spend a maximum of 3 minutes per event for a total up-to 20 mins. 
It’s natural for participants to name an event 2 years in the past, or to request to work from a point in time in the past, back to current state. To construct a vision of the system by its events that is not causal in nature and therefore not subject to narrative bias it’s important to work backwards, from the current state.

5. Heaven
What is the best possible scenario state in the future? Imagine an impossibly good future (heaven) and describe the conditions/experience of heaven. There are no constraints. Money is not an issue. People are not an issue. Technology is not an issue. Think big. 
Ask the group to spend ~5 mins writing down as many points as they can to describe heaven (1 per hexie).

6. Turning points backwards from heaven
Make heaven happen. Connect heaven to a past event with fictional events.
What is the most significant recent event that preceded the heaven state? Ask the group to identify the (fictional) turning points (key events) back from heaven. Spend a maximum of 3 minutes per event for a total up-to 20 mins.

7. Hell
What is the worst possible scenario in the future? Imagine an impossibly bad future (hell) and describe the conditions/experience of hell. 
Ask the group to spend ~5 minutes writing down as many points as they can to describe hell (1 per hexie).

8. Turning points backwards from hell
Make hell happen. Connect hell to a past event with fictional events.
What is the most significant recent event that preceded hell? 
Ask the group to identify the (fictional) turning points (key events) back from hell. Spend a maximum of 3 minutes per event for a total up-to 20 mins. 

9. Turning points on heaven or hell pathway
What are the key turning points describe in current state (backwards) that would help us to get on the path to heaven? or on the path to hell? 
What would make the difference between the heaven and hell paths at this point? Ask the group to identify 1 – 2 turning points. These are linked with arrows. 

10. Close
If you’ve run the activity with multiple groups, bring them back together to share their outcomes.
Wrap up the activity and let participants know next steps.
