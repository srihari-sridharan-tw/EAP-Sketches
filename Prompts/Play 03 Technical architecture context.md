# Technical architecture context

Like business context, having technical architecture context is crucial for successful Enterprise Architecture initiatives.  
Architecture context provides the foundation for making informed decisions, identifying and mitigating potential risks, and ensuring the architecture  effectively serves the business needs in the long run.
Whilst gathering architecture context, it is important to wear a business hat as well as a technical hat and ensure you understand the architecture within the relevant business/domain context. This includes understanding how regulatory policies or internal policies impact the architecture too.  

## Use this play to:

Identify and understand the current technical architecture 
Provide a quick assessment of architectural complexity
Understand how the technical architecture supports core business functions

## Expert tip

Beyond simply diving into the technical architecture, understanding how the architecture supports core business functions is essential. To do this, follow the money. Engage with business stakeholders to follow the financial flow to see how technology directly impacts revenue generation, cost reduction, or other key metrics. 

## Time required

1 - 5 days

## Who participates

Architects, project team

## How often

Once-off / as needed

## Running the play

1. Bound your context
Before you start, determine the required breadth level of detail. Do you need fine detail? Or will a level 1 systems context view suffice? By clearly defining the context, you can ensure that your research and analysis is focused, relevant, and effective.

2. Desk research
Gather as much context as you can through existing documentation. See what is discoverable by searching the organizations wiki and shared drives. In doing so, you will also gauge their practices around documentation, communication, collaboration and transparency.

3. Interviews and workshops
Have architects, principal or lead engineers walk you through their architecture diagrams. If diagrams don’t exist, draw it with them. You may need to engage with many folks across the organization to draw the existing architecture before you get to a holistic picture. You don’t need to make it a formal drawing, keep it simple with boxes and lines.

In some cases, where knowledge has left the building, or for complex systems, running an event storming workshop or path to production workshop might help uncover critical aspects of the architecture. 

4. Broader context
Reach further into the tentacles of the organization to get a broader understanding of the architecture, how it supports and enables the business, and what regulatory/internal policies impact the architecture. Importantly, follow the financial flow to see how technology directly impacts revenue generation, cost reduction, or other key metrics. 

5. Trust but verify
Validate stakeholder input by selectively investigating code, configs, or testing, focusing on key assumptions rather than a full assessment. Define a bounded scope using sponsor insights and supplement with production metrics or SLA/SLO data to surface hidden risks.
