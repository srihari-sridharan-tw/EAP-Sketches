# Business strategy

One of the very first things an Enterprise Architect must do is understand the business strategy, along with the business goals and measures of success.
Understanding the business strategy is not as simple as having a copy of the strategy shared with you. It is important to know what played out behind the scenes and the thinking that went into creating the strategy. Whether a business strategy, goals, objectives and measures of success exist or not, this play will help you discover what exists and why, and how it is perceived in the organization. 

## Use this play to:

Understand the business strategy.
Understand the business model(s) and how value is created and captured.
Understand the business goals and objectives and how these are measured.
Understand how the business strategy came about and how it is communicated to the organization. 

## Expert tip

If a business strategy does not exist or is hard to pull out of individuals, try to reverse engineer one by researching annual general reports and media releases. Once you’ve constructed something, playback for key stakeholders to correct. Sometimes presenting something wrong can elicit what you’re after.

## Time required

1 - 3 hours

## Who participates

Architects, executives, key senior stakeholders

## Running the play

1. Identify stakeholders to walk you through the strategy
If the person responsible for the business strategy is easy to identify, excellent. If not, seek to meet with executives and senior business leaders to take you through the business strategy, goals and objectives and measures of success. 
Hearing it from different stakeholders will highlight how well the strategy is understood at the top of the organization and where there might be misalignment. 

2. Walk through of the strategy
Once you have time with key business leaders and executives, ask them to walk you through the strategy. 
It’s important to listen first. Allow the stakeholders to share the strategy/goals/objectives/measures of success first, before diving into questions. Interrupting and jumping into questions might make the stakeholder/s feel like you are judging the strategy and they may become defensive.

3. Gain a deeper understanding
Use the list of questions on the next page to get a deeper understanding of why the strategy exists, how it was/is communicated to the organization and how well they are executing the strategy. 

4. Playback your understanding
Take some time after the initial meeting/s to gather your notes/collective thoughts, then book time to playback your understanding of the strategy with those stakeholders who shared it with you. 
In doing so, you gain clarity on your understanding of the business strategy and and correct where you may have misinterpreted the strategy.
