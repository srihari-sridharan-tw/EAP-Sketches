How to use this playbook

This playbook has been divided into two broad categories, Business Technology Alignment and Execution and Governance.

Execution and Governance
Execution and Governance seeks to understand how the Enterprise Architecture function can help the organization deliver value and generate revenue. Execution 
and Governance focuses on laying paved roads, and creating aligned autonomy for technology teams. 

Business Technology Alignment
Business Technology Alignment looks to build an understanding of the business and of technology. 
It helps the Enterprise Architecture function and technology leaders understand:
who are the organization's customers and partners
what are the product, business 
and technology capabilities
how does the organization deliver value and generate revenue
what are the business and technology constraints the organization is operating within, and
how can the organization align the business strategy with technology.

A play is a step-by-step guide to get you to a desired end state. It could be a stand-alone play, or one that is a stepping stone to another. 
Plays don’t have to be executed in any specific order. Mix and match, and use the most appropriate play to solve your problem at hand.
