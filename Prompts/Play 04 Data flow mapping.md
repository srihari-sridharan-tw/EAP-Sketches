Play #4

# Data flow mapping

Understand the structure of the system, the types of data used and the major components and their responsibilities.

## Use this play to:

Identify the major components of the system and their responsibilities
Identify the main data flows of the system
Understand main integration points
Understand main users of the system

## Expert tip

Most systems will have more than one major data flow. It’s often clearer to show each flow on a separate diagram but use the same structure and positioning of components across all of them to aid the team in understanding how the flows relate to one another.

## Time required

30 - 60 minutes each

## Who participates

Architects, principal developers, data analysts

## How often

As needed

## Running the play

At the end of this play, you should have one or more data flow maps that show how data moves from one user or system to another. It’s useful to have a high-level understanding of the major components before beginning this play.

In order to run this play successfully, you’ll need access to people familiar with the systems involved, as well as either a physical or virtual whiteboard.

1. Identify the major data flows. For example, for a product catalog for an e-commerce retailer, these might be adding a new product to the catalog, updating the images for an existing product, and retiring a product from sale.

2. Identify the major users and systems involved. See the following page for an example.
If you’re running this play physically, use a single sticky note for each user or system.

3. For each of the identified data flows, start at the origin and trace its path through each system until completion.
Number and annotate each step in the flow to explain the series of steps. For example: “step 2: retrieve product images from third-party data provider”.
If you’re running this play physically and are drawing multiple flows on a single diagram, it can be helpful to use a different color for each flow to distinguish them from each other. If you’re running this play virtually, it’s usually clearest to create a separate diagram for each flow.
