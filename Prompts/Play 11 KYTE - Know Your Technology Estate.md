# KYTE: Know Your Technology Estate

Once you have an understanding of the architecture, the next step is to capture all of the components and resources associated with the architecture to create a comprehensive picture of the technology estate. 
Without a comprehensive understanding of the technology estate, blind spots may arise, leading to inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and missed opportunities. 
By understanding the technology estate, you can ensure it aligns with business goals, optimize costs, improve security posture, and make informed decisions about future technology investments.

## Use this play to:

Create a detailed record of your organization's architecture components (e.g. a deployable unit) and resources
Identify ownership responsibilities and any ownership gaps
Understand how the architecture is supported and maintained across the organization 

Note: this play assumes the organization lacks a comprehensive service repository or internal developer portal documenting its technology landscape.

## Expert tip

Make this a collaborative effort across technology. Be transparent in the purpose and benefits and how folks can contribute. Share the findings and insights and open up a discussion with the technology organization to help identify areas for improvement and gain buy-in.
 
## Time required

1 - 4 weeks

## Who participates

Architects, delivery and technology teams and team members

## How often

Once-off, then ongoing maintenance as required

## Fundamentals

### Data storage and management

Before getting started decide how the information will be collected, stored and managed. For example, will you be using a spreadsheet or perhaps a CMDB (configuration management database) tool? 
Who will have access to it and how will you ensure it is secure? 

### Potential challenges

You may face resistance from teams. Clearly communicate the purpose, what you need, and the benefits to them and the organization.
Have a technology leader set context in a wider forum and reinforce it through management lines. This ensures teams are aware before you reach out.
Minimize their burden - opt for a 30-minute conversation with them instead of sending out a survey.

### Ongoing maintenance and updates

Once you have collected the information, ensure you have a process and mechanism in place to keep the information up to date. 
This might mean having ‘champions’ responsible for maintaining it, it might mean as a group of Architects you take on responsibility. However it looks, make sure you’ve established responsibility and a cadence to maintain the inventory and a mechanism for updates. 

### Gathering information

This play describes collecting information by asking questions and conversing with teams. In addition to this, automated discovery tools can also identify and capture services and configurations. These tools are especially valuable when knowledge gaps exist. 
Consider leveraging observability tooling, security scanners, or cloud inventory solutions to streamline this process.

## Running the play

1. Determine the scope of your inventory
Decide what information you are looking to collect. 
Given you will be talking to all teams, it could be beneficial going a little broader in your questions to gain a comprehensive understanding of the technology landscape within the organization. For example, in addition to recording the services teams maintain and the technology stack they are using, you might consider collecting information on their engineering and deployment practices too.

2. Draft a set of questions and possible responses
Draft a set of questions and responses (note that you will want to keep responses as consistent as possible for record keeping and comparison, hence drafting a standard set of responses for each question).
A set of sample questions has been provided at the end of this play. Modify these questions to suit your context. 

3. Sense check
Sense check the questions with a couple of principal or lead engineers, or engineering managers.

4. Identify teams 
Gather a list of all delivery/development teams. 
Depending on the organization and how long you’ve been there this could be a quick and simple task, or a drawn out one.
Include all teams that build and deliver products, be it internal facing products (i.e. a platform engineering team), data products, or external facing products.

5. Identify delegates within each team
Identify 2 representatives from each team. You will want 2 developers of different seniority to get a well rounded perspective. 
We don’t generally include the whole team as we find it can slow things down and may see unnecessary debates arise within the team. 
You do want folks who are close to the code. An engineering manager or principal engineer who is not hands-on coding day-to-day won’t be the right people to speak with. 

6. Schedule time with each team
Next, you’ll want to schedule time with each team to go through the questions. Thirty minutes is generally enough time to go through all of the questions per team. 
In large organizations, group sessions for similar teams is an efficient approach.
As tempting as it might be to simply send a survey and ask folks to complete it, we find having face-to-face conversations much more effective for a number of reasons, including: 
they help you to build or extend your relationship with the team/developers
you gain additional context through the conversation that you wouldn’t get via a form
you get better consistency in responses
both you and the team representatives can ask clarifying questions
you take the burden off the teams - have you ever heard of someone getting excited about a survey? 

7. Collect information from the teams
Collect information from the teams. You may want to do a trial run with a couple of teams from different departments first and make any necessary adjustments to the questions before continuing on to all teams. 

8. Collate and share
Once you’ve gathered all information collate it, visualise it and make it accessible. 
While the purpose of this exercise may have been for you and your team to deepen your knowledge of the current technology landscape, inventory components and the technology stack, the rest of the organization will also find the information insightful. 
Share what you have, run a walkthrough session and open up a discussion on what you are seeing.
