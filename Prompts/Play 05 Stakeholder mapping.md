# Stakeholder mapping

Knowing who your stakeholders are and how to communicate with them could be the difference between having a successful, visible architecture presence in the organization or architecture being an afterthought.
Stakeholder mapping is essential for the success of any team or project and allows teams to prioritize and target time spent building relationships and to identify risks in their stakeholder landscape.

## Use this play to:
Identify stakeholders
Define communication methods 
and frequency of communications with stakeholders
Better manage stakeholders expectations

## Expert tip
Stakeholder mapping may not appear be a high priority for Architects, but getting this right by knowing who their stakeholders are,  who needs to be influenced, and how to communicate with them will help put architects on the map within the organization and help them to deliver their work successfully.

## Time required
90 minutes

## Who participates
Architects

## How often
Every 6 months

## Fundamentals

A stakeholder is an individual (or group of people) who have an interest in, or influence of, the Architects or the work the architecture team produces.

## Stakeholder Mapping Matrix

  Axes

  - Vertical (Y-axis): Influence (LOW → HIGH)
  - Horizontal (X-axis): Interest / availability (LOW → HIGH)

  ---
  High influence / low interest

  Strategy: Keep satisfied

  - Those with significant decision-making authority
  - Lack availability or interest to be actively engaged
  - Usually difficult to consistently engage

  ---
  High influence / high interest

  Strategy: Actively engage

  - Those with significant decision-making authority
  - Can kill, sustain or nurture the project
  - Typically easy to engage

  ---
  Low influence / low interest

  Strategy: Monitor

  - Those who aren't significantly involved / may not even be aware of the project
  - Monitor movement into other quadrants

  ---
  Low influence / high interest

  Strategy: Keep informed

  - Those who may be impacted by the project, but have little influence
  - May want more of your time than you can give

## Publication

It’s generally a good idea to keep publication of a stakeholder map internal to the team. Stakeholders may not like seeing themselves ranked as “low influence”. Related artifacts that are safer to make visible include a comms plan (for each stakeholder, how and when will we communicate / interact), and a RACI matrix (who will be involved for what kind of things, with what decision authority).

## Running the play

1. Make a list of stakeholders
    * On sticky notes, ask team members to write down the names and roles of their stakeholders (one stakeholder per note).
    * Use different colored post-its to represent internal vs external stakeholders.
2. Prioritize
    * Once you have defined the list of stakeholders, place them on the map according to their level of interest / influence. This step can involve a lot of discussion between team members so allow plenty of time for this.
3. Categorise
    * Using sticky dots, indicate if the stakeholders are a Business Owner; 
    * Major Stakeholder; Minor Stakeholder; Subject Matter Expert
